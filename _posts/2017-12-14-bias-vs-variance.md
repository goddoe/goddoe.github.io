## Bias vs Variance
# 1. Diagnosing bias vs variance  with cost vs degree of polynome degree plot

1) "The training error will tend to decrease as we increase the degree d of the polynomial.
At the same time, the cross validation error will tend to decrease as we increase d up to a point, and then it will increase as d is increased, forming a convex curve."
